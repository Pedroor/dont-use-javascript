The purpose of this repository is to expand technical knowledge through initial contact with other programming languages, to carry out this study I chose to work with GO and Swift and for the next 250 days I will be sharing my learning in this repository, my objective with this challenge and in the end of the 250 days to have an MVP for a product that is still in the analysis phase.


As a basis I will use two courses that I think are very good within each community along with the help of official documentation and external content from the community.
